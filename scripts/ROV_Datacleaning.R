#Intro to dplyr, bullet point #3. (this is a super useful package to use, I use it for almost everything)

# Open install_packages.R script separately and run it. 
#This creates a super easy function to install packages quickly for the rest of your work
#now install these packages using the lp function

## Create unique site ID 

## this function will pull the first 4 letters of a character and then paste them in a new column to make a unique site ID 
## this will allow us to merge datasets using this column 
ROVFish$Site_ID <- substr(ROVFish$Filename, 1, 4)

## load in nootka data 
load("nootkadata.Rdata")
## Lets make a dataset with Site info for each site. 

colnames(nootkadata)

siteinfo2 <- unique(nootkadata[, c("Site_ID", "Date", "Temp", "Lat_Decimal", "Long_Decimal")])

## Create a function to calculate Fish abundance per site 

get.abundance <- function(xx){ 
  keep <- which(ROVFish$Site_ID == xx)
  if (length(keep) == 0) return(0)
  return(sum(ROVFish$Number[keep]))
}

head(siteinfo2)
## Use Mapply to fill siteinfo2 with total number of fish 
siteinfo2$Abundance <- mapply(get.abundance, xx = siteinfo2$Site_ID)
