## if you read in the file as a excel vs csv it will keep column class's proper for doing time calculations.

## Convert the excel time to a time usable in R ## 
# I struggled getting time calculations because in time columns on excel there was written out NA's this caused the it to be chr not POSIXct 

## T2 and T3 times were loaded in as fractions instead of the format of the last one
## "0.41319444444444442": This is also a representation of time as a fraction of a day.
## RESOLVED: as some of the times are missing for T2 and T3 missing
## there was NA written into the excel file with made the dates show up as fractions and characters 
## removing NA from the excel file solved this issue

 
## Calculate the duration for transect for each transect ## 
nootkadata$T1_duration <- nootkadata$T1_End - nootkadata$T1_Start

## calculate the total time at site ## 
nootkadata$site_duration <- nootkadata$T3_End - nootkadata$T1_Start

## How long between the end of transect 1 to the ROV transect = time for the fish to move 
nootkadata$T2_T1_duration <- nootkadata$T2_Start - nootkadata$T1_End

## Depth differnences ## 
nootkadata$T1_DepthDif <- nootkadata$T1_Edepth - nootkadata$T1_Sdepth

nootkadata$T2_DepthDif <- nootkadata$T2_Edepth - nootkadata$T2_Sdepth

## Lat and long conversion calculations ##
